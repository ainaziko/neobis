1. Passwords were not yet encoded (now every password of new user is encoded)
2. All api endpoints were accessible to everyone (it is accessible now after authentication to users) I am planning to make it accessible for admin
3. Every page was unsecured. Now there are some pages permitted to everyone and others accessible for signed up users
4. It is possible to set a password "". I need to make requirements for password in service
